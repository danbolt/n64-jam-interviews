            Lunar Assault 64 is danielface's submission for the N64Brew Game Jam. The gameplay follows the story of Wren Buster, a young Lunar Spotter hired to rid the moon's tech parks of Lunarbeasts. The game alternates between action and dialogue segments. In the former, the player is tasked with aiming for a satelite laser towards a rampaging Lunarbeast's weak spots. In the latter, Wren comes to terms with the dissilusionment of their dream job.

    <h2>Chatting with danielface</h2>

    <p class="interview-question">What got you into Nintendo 64 homebrew?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The most straightforward answer is probably the COVID-19 pandemic. With the social distancing guidelines in place where I live, I've had a lot more time to debug memory alignment issues! </p>
        <p>A more emotional reason might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjGFkYRf8UI">a talk</a> by Rachel Simone Weil on homebrew that I saw a few years ago. Her words stuck out to me, as she discussed how homebrew can recontextualize a game console in people's minds. I never owned a Nintendo 64 as a child in the mid-90s, but the occasions where I played it always felt very magical to me. When I became a teenager, a lot of the online discussion on games that I read was often written by people older than me. I noticed <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/192/retronauts-episode-74-nintendo-64">their experiences</a> on the Nintendo 64 tended to have a different feeling. They approached the console having grown up with NES games, and the experiences of the Sony PlayStation suited them better as they became young adults. In the twilight years of my twenties, I wanted to inject a reflection of my youth onto the Nintendo 64.</p>

    <p class="interview-question">How did you come up with the concept for your game? Was there anything about the jam's theme that stood out to you?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Going in, I knew I wanted to make something that felt closer to a Sony PlayStation game than something found on the Nintendo 64. I planned on rejecting frequently-seen elements of the latter, namely Z-buffering, texture filtering, and the controller's right-handed orientation. I knew also I wanted to lean on 2D assets or animations to give a non-cinematic impression where I could. The big character portraits in Crime Crackers came to mind.</p>
        <p>I often find myself initially stumped with certain kinds of game jam themes, especially so if they're broad and open-ended! Themes like "alone", "change", or "conflict" always leave me in a vaccum. When the theme of "size" was announced, I was in a similar situation at first. I had to think on it for a while. </p>
