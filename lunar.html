            Lunar Assault 64 was danielface's submission for the jam. The gameplay follows the story of Wren Buster, a young Lunar Spotter hired to rid the moon's tech parks of Lunarbeasts. The game alternates between action and dialogue segments. In the former, the player is tasked with aiming for a satelite laser towards a rampaging Lunarbeast's weak spots. In the latter, Wren comes to terms with the dissilusionment of their dream job.

    <h2>Chatting with danielface</h2>

    <p class="interview-question">What got you into Nintendo 64 homebrew?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The most straightforward answer is probably the COVID-19 pandemic. With the social distancing guidelines in place where I live, I've had a lot more time to debug memory alignment issues! </p>
        <p>A more emotional reason might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjGFkYRf8UI">a talk</a> by Rachel Simone Weil on homebrew that I saw a few years ago. Her words stuck out to me, as she discussed how homebrew can recontextualize a game console in people's minds. I never owned a Nintendo 64 as a child in the mid-90s, but the occasions where I played it always felt very magical to me. When I became a teenager, a lot of the online discussion on games that I read was often written by people older than me. I noticed <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/192/retronauts-episode-74-nintendo-64">their experiences</a> on the Nintendo 64 tended to have a different feeling. They approached the console having grown up with NES games, and the experiences of the Sony PlayStation suited them better as they became young adults. In the twilight years of my twenties, I wanted to inject a reflection of my youth onto the Nintendo 64.</p>

    <p class="interview-question">How did you come up with the concept for your game? Was there anything about the jam's theme that stood out to you?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Going in, I knew I wanted to make something that felt closer to a Sony PlayStation game than something found on the Nintendo 64. I planned on rejecting frequently-seen elements of the latter, namely Z-buffering, texture filtering, and the controller's right-handed orientation. I knew also I wanted to lean on 2D assets or animations to give a non-cinematic impression where I could. The big character portraits in Crime Crackers came to mind.</p>
        <p>I often find myself initially stumped with certain kinds of game jam themes, especially if they're broad and open-ended! Themes like "alone", "change", or "conflict" always leave me in a vaccum. If a jam theme is a simple noun, like "cats" or "two buttons", I find I can come up with something quickly. When the theme of "size" was announced, I was in a similar situation at first and had to think for a while.</p>
        <p>The Angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion ended up being the key reference point for me. Creating a creature in a giant landscape felt achieveable for what I could personally do within the timeframe of two months. I was pretty conscious not to center the game around too many ingame objects or projectiles. I designated the first month for core features, and the latter month for polish.</p>

    <p class="interview-question">What tools did you end up using to create your game?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The game was programmed with libultra and the Nintendo 64 SDK. The chracter art was authored in Krita and then scaled down with GIMP. The 3D models and the FMV intro were done in Blender. Some of the sound effects were made in BambooTracker. The locking/clicking noise for Wren's scope came from recording pieces of Lego snapping together and distorting the sounds in Audacity. The rest of the sounds were made with various in LMMS.</p>
        <p>The music was sourced from the Creative Commons, in particular by a French musician called <a href="https://morusque.bandcamp.com/">Morusque</a>. Instead of traditional instrument samples, I tried to make a bunch of tones with the FM synth emulator found in BambooTracker. I think that gave the tones a bit of a unique character compared to some of the MIDI samples used in other Nintendo 64 games.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="interview-question">Is there anything you particularily enjoy about your game, or is there something you worked on that you're particularily proud of?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I don't make any claims of being a skilled writer, but I tried to put a three-act structure into the game's three levels. It feels like a nice beginning-middle-end to me, and I like that the character's progression isn't a typical "triumph over evil" story. I didn't want that in a Nintendo 64 game this time around.</p>
        <p>
            My Dad voiced the intro FMV you see at the start of the game, and growing up he was pretty keen on us not saying curse words. I'm very happy that I got to immortalize him saying the word "shitty" into a Nintendo 64 ROM.
