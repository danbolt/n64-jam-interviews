            Sblobber64 is danielface's submission for the N64Brew Game Jam. The gameplay follows the story of Wren Buster, a young Lunar Spotter hired to rid the moon's tech parks of Lunarbeasts. The game alternates between action and dialogue segments. In the former, the player is tasked with aiming a satelite laser to destroy a rampaging Lunarbeast's weak spots. In the latter, Wren comes to terms with their newfound dissilusionment in work.
