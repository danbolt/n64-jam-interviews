    <h2>Chatting with danielface</h2>

    <p class="interview-question">What got you into Nintendo 64 homebrew?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Victor:</strong> I have fond memories of playing the N64 when I was young. Mario64 was so amazing, compared to the 2d games from the previous generations.</p>
        <p>I'm a Software Engineer and I always wanted to work on game development in my spare time. The N64brew Jam gave me the opportunity to do so on my favorite console :)</p>
        <p><strong>Isabel:</strong> I got into retrogaming a few years ago when I attended the annual retro game expo in Portland. I found the talks incredibly entertaining, funny and really interesting from a technical point of view. </p>
        <p>I’ve wanted to build a small game on an old console since then and Victor being a N64 fan, it seemed natural and the perfect opportunity to join the N64brew Jam and do so.</p>

    <p class="interview-question">How did you come up with the concept for your game? Was there anything about the jam's theme that stood out to you?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Isabel:</strong> We thought about a few ‘character changing size’ ideas but we couldn’t build an enjoyable and fun gameplay around our ideas at first. One of my favorite types of games are puzzle games so we started thinking about the gameplay in that way. We wanted to build something that would be fun to solve, so we made the ‘character changing size’ part of the puzzle and that’s how we came out with Sblobber64.</p>

        <p><strong>Victor:</strong> Due to the time constraint and size of our team, we decided pretty quickly our entry for the jam was going to be a 2d game. After playing around with a few ideas, we figured the "movement impact size" concept was the most enjoyable. We wrote a quick text-based prototype to test the gameplay and after seeing the idea in action and enjoying the game, we decided to move forward with this idea.
        </p>

    <p class="interview-question">What tools did you end up using to create your game?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We used the libdragon sdk, writing our game in C. It's good for 2d games and is 100% free & open-source. We also used the Golang programming language for the prototype.</p>
        <p>For the code editor we used VSCode and to edit our (simple) graphics we found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pixilart.com/">www.pixilart.com</a> to be pretty easy to use.</p>
        <p>For the maps we now use an editor: Tiled (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">mapeditor.org</a>) that is also free and open source and we convert them to our custom format with a small script written in Golang.</p>

    <p class="interview-question">Is there anything you particularily enjoy about your game, or is there something you worked on that you're particularily proud of?</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Isabel:</strong> I loved participating in the Jam and getting to see how creative and smart the participants' games were. I also loved learning how to use the N64 development tools that the community has built. We had a lot of fun finding an idea that will pair the theme of the Jam :‘size’ and a type of game we really like: ‘puzzle’, I’m proud that we found a way for these concepts to work together and that the idea came to life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Victor:</strong> The thing that I’m the most proud of is that we were actually able to produce a “finished” game, including intro, music, menus, multiple (although only a few) levels and an ending. We had plenty of ideas for the game and I’m happy we were able to prioritize them so our game looks like a real game. I’m also very happy that we continue working on the game, implementing the rest of our ideas, for example, at the time we submitted our game, we were writing the maps by hand (using the custom format mentioned above). It was pretty tiresome, that is why we only had a handful of maps. Later we started looking at well-known map formats but they were a bit too "heavy" for the N64.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is when Isabel had the idea of getting the best of both worlds, using an existing map editor (Tiled) to generate levels with ease and later when compiling the ROM, convert the .tmx files to our custom map format (more optimized for our needs).
