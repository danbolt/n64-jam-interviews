    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
        Towards the end of 2020, I participated in the N64Brew Game Jam. All the participants ended up producing original homebrew for the Nintendo 64. Each entry had its own character, plus it was a lot of fun to play everyone's work. Quite a few of us also had enjoyed the Nintendo 64 in our formative years, so it was neat to revisit the console as adults.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I found interesting though, was the history of people doing Nintendo 64 homebrew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980613235114/http://www.dextrose.com/pom.htm">decades</a> <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/demo.htm">before</a> us. It's not too hard to find those old ROMs and demos, but it's not always easy to get a sense of the stories behind them. I would watch YouTube videos of homebrew creators from the 1990s and want to ask them what their experiences were. Their works seemed mysterious by internet standards; like artifacts of an ancient civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that everyone's still releatively active on the N64Brew Discord server, I figure I'd try to document the stories behind the entries today. My hope is that you'll be able to understand the experiences of the people making these games. They're each a gem in their own way, and I don't want that to be lost to time.
